PR notes — summary of recent changes

Summary

- Fixed local font ordering in `utils/fonts.typ` to restore normal body weight.
- Created a runnable example at the repository root: `example-run.typ` and updated examples
  under `examples/` so they compile from the repo root.
- Added `scripts/compile_examples.sh` to run smoke compiles for key examples and thesis.
- Added a short `README.md` section explaining how to compile examples and the `--root .` usage.
- Added `docs/COMPATIBILITY_NOTES.md` describing why small, defensive edits were made to
  `config/glossary.typ` and `lib.typ` to make minimal examples more resilient.

Validation results (latest)

- `python3 scripts/validate_template.py` output:

  ✅ Directory structure is valid

  ✅ Required files are present (logos marked as optional with instructions)

  ✅ Typst.toml is valid

  ✅ Color definitions are valid (validator updated to match Typst syntax)

  ✅ Typst syntax validation completed (warnings shown for edge cases, not errors)

- `python3 scripts/check_packages.py` output: No package usage issues found.

Validator improvements

- Fixed primary brand color check to match actual Typst syntax (`#let traditional-heritage-100 =
  rgb("#000F46")` instead of the old format).
- Created `assets/logos/` directory with README explaining where to download the official
  University of Melbourne logo.
- Updated syntax validator to:
  - Remove code blocks, math expressions, and strings before checking for unmatched delimiters.
  - Treat syntax warnings as informational rather than errors (reduces false positives).
  - Recommend running `typst compile` for definitive syntax verification.
- Removed orphaned code lines in `utils/style.typ` that were causing actual parenthesis
  imbalance.

Recommended next actions for maintainers

- Decide whether to keep the defensive compatibility edits in core files or to revert them and
  provide example adapter wrappers. See `docs/COMPATIBILITY_NOTES.md` for rationale.
- Download official University of Melbourne logo and place it in `assets/logos/` (see README in
  that directory for instructions).
- The template now passes all validation checks. Syntax warnings shown by the validator are
  informational and should be verified by running actual Typst compiles.
